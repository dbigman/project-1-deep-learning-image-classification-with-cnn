## Phase 1: Data Preprocessing

### Data Loading
- **Download Dataset:**  
  Obtain the chosen dataset from the provided link.
- **Load Data:**  
  Use libraries such as:
  - `torchvision.datasets` for PyTorch  
  - `tf.keras.datasets` for TensorFlow  

### Data Exploration & Visualization
- **Visualize Sample Images:**  
  Display 5-10 images from each class using matplotlib or seaborn.
- **Analyze Class Distribution:**  
  Check for class balance and plan strategies to handle imbalanced data if needed.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- **Handle Missing Values:**  
  (If applicable)
- **Label Encoding:**  
  Convert categorical labels to numerical format.

### Data Transformation
- **Normalization:**  
  Scale pixel values (e.g., between 0 and 1 or using mean and standard deviation).
- **Resizing:**  
  Ensure all images are of uniform size (e.g., 32x32 for CIFAR-10).
- **Data Augmentation:**  
  Apply transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming to enhance dataset diversity.

### Create Data Loaders
- **Split Dataset:**  
  Divide into training, validation, and testing (typically 70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing).
- **Batching:**  
  Define appropriate batch sizes (e.g., 32 or 64).

## Phase 2: Model Architecture

### Design CNN Architecture
- **Convolutional Layers:**  
  Define the number of layers, filter sizes, and activation functions (e.g., ReLU).
- **Pooling Layers:**  
  Incorporate max pooling or average pooling to reduce spatial dimensions.
- **Fully Connected Layers:**  
  Add dense layers leading to the output layer with softmax activation for classification.
- **Dropout Layers:**  
  Include dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

### Implement Model
- **Framework-Specific Implementation:**  
  Use PyTorch's `nn.Module` or TensorFlow/Keras' Model API.
- **Modularity:**  
  Design the architecture to be modular for easy adjustments.

## Phase 3: Model Training

### Define Loss Function & Optimizer
- **Loss Function:**  
  Use cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.
- **Optimizer:**  
  Choose between:
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
  - Adam (justify choice based on experimentation or literature).

### Set Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate:**  
  Start with 0.001 for Adam or 0.01 for SGD.
- **Batch Size:**  
  Typically 32 or 64.
- **Number of Epochs:**  
  Start with 50-100 epochs and monitor for early stopping.

### Implement Training Loop
- **Forward Pass:**  
  Compute predictions.
- **Backward Pass:**  
  Compute gradients and update weights.
- **Logging:**  
  Track training and validation loss/accuracy.

### Early Stopping & Checkpointing
- **Early Stopping:**  
  Monitor validation loss to halt training when performance plateaus.
- **Model Checkpointing:**  
  Save the best model based on validation performance.

## Phase 4: Model Evaluation

### Evaluate on Validation/Test Set
- **Compute Metrics:**  
  Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score (using libraries like scikit-learn).
- **Generate Classification Report:**  
  Provide detailed per-class performance metrics.

### Confusion Matrix
- **Visualization:**  
  Use seaborn’s `heatmap` or similar tools to plot the confusion matrix.
- **Analysis:**  
  Identify classes where the model performs well or struggles.

### Performance Analysis
- **Overfitting/Underfitting Check:**  
  Compare training and validation metrics.
- **Adjustments:**  
  Consider regularization techniques or architectural changes if necessary.

## Phase 6: Transfer Learning

### Select Pre-trained Model
- **Options:**  
  - VGG16
  - Inception
  - ResNet
- **Justification:**  
  Choose based on model complexity, performance on similar tasks, and computational resources.

### Implement Transfer Learning
- **Load Pre-trained Weights:**  
  Exclude the top layers if necessary.
- **Freeze Layers:**  
  Initially freeze the convolutional base to retain learned features.
- **Modify Output Layers:**  
  Adapt final layers to match the number of classes in your dataset.

### Fine-Tuning
- **Unfreeze Some Layers:**  
  Allow fine-tuning of select layers for improved performance.
- **Re-train Model:**  
  Use a lower learning rate to adjust pre-trained weights.

### Evaluate Transfer Learning Model
- **Performance Comparison:**  
  Compare with the custom CNN to assess if transfer learning has improved model metrics.
