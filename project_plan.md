# Project Plan: Deep Learning Image Classification with CNN

This document outlines the project plan for building an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The plan is organized into multiple phases, covering the entire pipeline from project initialization to final submission.

---

## Phase 1: Project Initialization

### Understand Project Requirements
- **Review Task Description:**  
  Ensure a clear understanding of all components and expectations.
- **Select Dataset:**  
  Choose between CIFAR-10 or the animal images dataset based on interest and familiarity.

### Set Up Development Environment
- **Choose Programming Language & Framework:**  
  - Python with PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- **Install Necessary Libraries:**  
  - NumPy, pandas, matplotlib/seaborn for visualization.
  - Deep learning libraries (PyTorch/TensorFlow, Keras).
- **Version Control:**  
  - Initialize a Git repository to track changes.

### Organize Project Structure
- **Directory Setup:**
